# Inroduction to Insurance

Many people naturally see insurance as something they keep paying as they "should" or they are "affraid of" an accident. This is a consumer part of it. If we look at it from the other perspective (of a person doing the work), it is one of the most interesting professions due to the extreme variety of work and great analytical opportunities. But one of the downsides of this complexity is that one can get easily lost in what is actually happening :( For this reason, let's go back to real basics and try thinking about what insurance is.

## Working for insurance profession

If we take away all the "standard" functions that work in all industries (accountants, project managers, risk managers, IT, ...) we get to someone who is called "Actuary" and "Underwriter". Both are trying to manage risk (likelyhood of accidents) and money (the premium) so that the company is profitable, but one (*the actuary*) is looking at data and the other (*the underwriter*) is using his experience and professional judgement. In this course we will focus on the data aspect.

## Actuaries predicting future

The role of *actuaries* in insurance is to try to project the trends in data and find out what the future claims are going to be before they happen, so that we can collect enough money up front to fund them. There are 2 types of "future":
1) Short term - within next year e.g. when you buy your next contract (focus of General Insurance)
2) Long term - many many years e.g. when people retire (focus of Life Insurance)

This time horizon drives everything. Methods, analysis, type of work, ... All is driven by the "timing of the projection".
This part of the course is specifically looking at General insurance => annual cycle of:
1) Collect premium
2) Have (or do not have) claims
3) Analyze the claims related data
* to understand what the future losses will be at the end of the year
* to understand what the future premiums should be
4) Repeat next year (by renewing the insurance contract and collecting next premium)

That is it... Now you know everything. It is not a big magic. The magic starts when you go into the details, as there are lots of them. As you slowly progress through the course, you will learn more and more about what each step actually means.
