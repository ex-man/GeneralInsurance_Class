# Introduction to losses and expenses

## Definition of insurance

The concept of **insurance** can be understood as a method of hedging financial losses of a group of insured that are exposed to the same kind of **loss**. The sharing of the losses is covered by a common fund that consists of a sum of financial contributions from the group of insured.

An insurer is a company that sells **insurance policies** that work as an entry ticket to the risk pooling and the fee paid is called **premium**. 

For example it is almost certain that within a single year in a certain large urban area there will be a car accident. Also it is almost certain, that not every car in the area will have an accident. Now if a car owner happens to be the one to have an accident, he will have to cover the losses he suffers. However, if the owner agrees to share his risk of suffering loss with a group of similar car owners in the area, for a certain fee, due to the fact that the probability of having an accident is less than 1, overall costs for an individual to cover the loss is reduced.

Thinking about this definition it is visible that the desired situation is to have the average risk of the group of the insured as small as possible. Therefore it is good to have the group of the insured bigger. In that case also the fund for the risk is larger and the fee for an individual insurance policy can be reduced.

## Losses

Now let’s have a look at insurance from the perspective of an insurance company. At the beginning there is an insurance company that sells insurance policies. Then there are people who buy the policies and are called **policy holders**. Since people buy insurance because there is a certain non-zero probability of an incident that will lead to a financial loss, there will be incidents that will require the issuer of the insurance policies to pay the costs of the damages from the accidents from the fund the company accumulates from the premiums. These costs are called **losses**.

From the point of view of the insurance company, we want to make some profit on our portfolio. Throughout this course we will go step by step and introduce the way of looking at the insurance data and using them to get to the point where we can predict our future losses. At this stage we want to start with checking how much our losses are and how our portfolio of insurance policies is doing.

## Expenses

Just like every company, insurance companies have their **expe
nses**, as well. Expenses can be fixed or variable. Fixed expenses are not directly connected to the size of the insurance business and therefore they are the same over a midrange time horizon.
Variable expenses are those that change when the volume of the business changes. In insurance those can be for example provisions that are paid to agents.

## Data preparation

So we want to start by looking at our portfolio and try to figure out if it is doing well in terms of profitability. In the ideal situation we could jump right into the data. However, actuaries often have to first prepare their data to get them into a form where they can be used for an analysis.

So we will start with it in [Data preparation exercise](data_prep_exercise_KPI.md) (please open a file named "data_prep_exercise.Rmd" to follow our exercise
