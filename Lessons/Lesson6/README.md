# Objective
To learn the techniques to improve basic GLM model

# Content
- Validation / Metrics to optimize [model_val.md](model_val.md)
- Feature Engineering alias techniques to improve GLM model [feature_engineering.md](feature_engineering.md)
- Technical Price 
- Final thoughts


#### Homework (6 points)  
Try to tune your model even better:
- Add more variables and use at least two techniques to feature engineer your variables [3b]. 
- Explain your steps on why you decided to improve model in such a way [3b].
