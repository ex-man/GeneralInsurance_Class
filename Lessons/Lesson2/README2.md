### Homework
1) Find out, which __year__ was the __most terrific__ for portfolio you have identified as __most profitable__ during the lesson and show it on the chart using `ggplot2` package. Write an explanation about your findings into the code as comment. __Commit__ it to your repository into `Lessons/Lesson2/Homework`.

2) Implement UWR chart into Class Shiny app. 
Edit file shiny_tab2_server.R (as server.R for lesson2) at `output$lesson2_KPI_multidim_table` with predefined input data and implement UWR chart we learned during lesson2 as dynamic view not only for `Unit`. Do not forget to commit your changes.
