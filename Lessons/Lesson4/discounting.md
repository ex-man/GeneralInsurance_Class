### Triangles in insurance
Do you know what this is? It is the core of Reserving and in many cases also pricing. This is also how the losses from previous
class were produced. It is a very simple way to get many answers like:

1) How long does it take to fully pay the claims?
2) How fast are they paid?
3) Is the initial estimate of the future conservative or optimistic?

There are far more questions and answers available, and there are many methods that can do the job. But for now, let's understand
at least the basics.


### What is a triangle
As losses take sometimes a number of years to be reported and then some more years to be paid, it is very hard
to say at the end of the year whether we have "saved" enough money. For this reason, it makes sense to keep history
of all claims related to 1 period.

Imagine this simple situation that shows a history of a single policy:

1) 1st December 2016 - insurance contract was signed to protect against car crash injury
2) 20th November 2017 - there was an accident. The person goes to hospital and does not care about calling insurance company
3) 1st January 2018 - person is finally home, but he will not be able to work for unknown time
4) 5th January 2018 - claim is reported. Doctors say, the person may require anoteher surgery in 6 months
5) 1st February 2018 - new symptoms are found (they seem to be coming from the accident) ...
6) a few years later - the person finally starts working, but is partially disabled


#### Think about which year each information relates to (Exercise 0)
_Write down into your notes, what you think... In which year(s) of data can we find the above situation. Then let's discuss._

It makes sense to keep a chronological history of how much was paid for each of the items above. If you have many policies and not just the one as above, it makes sense to group them together and form a chronological payment history for every year.
This is then usually displayed as a "triangle", where the rows represent the years of origin (policy, accident, reporting date)
and the columns represent how long it took until the information was recognized.


### What do we do with this?
Well, we want to take the advantage of the history that we have collected and predict what is likely to happen with the latest
year, that we have just got to know about. It is basically a variation of the Linear Regression, where you learn from past
patterns and apply them to predict future. To get what we are talking about, it is worth visualising this a bit. Use the ChainLadder package and explore the visaualize the triangle object from example there.

Load all necessary packages for the lesson 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ChainLadder)
```
Load data about KPIs
```{r}

dt_KPI <- read.csv("C:/Users/sk000413/Documents/University/GeneralInsurance_2019/GeneralInsurance_Class/Data/lesson2_KPI.csv")
dt_LatestView <- read.csv("C:/Users/sk000413/Documents/University/GeneralInsurance_2019/GeneralInsurance_Class/Data/lesson4_latestView.csv")
dt_PaidCase <- read.csv("C:/Users/sk000413/Documents/University/GeneralInsurance_2019/GeneralInsurance_Class/Data/lesson4_PaidCase.csv")
```

#### Exercise 1
_As we will be working with ChainLadder library, explore it a little bit._
To understand what it is doing run the example below (demo from ChainLadder library)

```{r}
GenIns
plot(GenIns)
plot(GenIns, lattice=TRUE)
```

_Think about some math, that could project the future for the "unfinished lines" (e.g. liner models?)_
To explore a bit of math, look at the exmaples from help section on "chainladder" function

```{r}
?chainladder
```

The thing that is actually predicting the future is the age-to-age factors.
Can you find them in the chainladder object?

_Now try to predict what happens with the linse using the chain ladder technique (hint: search for predict)_

Your solution
```{r}
?predict
predict(chainladder(GenIns))
```

At the end this is all about age-to-age factors. There are many methods that calculate them, but at the end once you get them you know, how much more the claim will be in x years.


#### Exercise 2
Now let's have a look at a couple of different triangles. The data is provided for 2 different businesses.
It also shows 2 different claim types for each. Can you describe how different they are?
Hint: Consider the length of tail, volatility, average sizes...
Hint2: There are 2 types of data - paid and case. Start using Paid...

_YOUR SOLUTION_
understand the data => run some simple overviews

create a variable => filter data and covert to triangle. then convert to cummulative to use chainladder

_STEP 1: Take paid data for House business and Small claim size_

```{r}
Paid_HH_sml <- dt_PaidCase %>% 
  filter(Business == "House" & ClaimSize == "Small" & dataset_type == "PAID")
head(Paid_HH_sml)

```

_STEP 2: Now convert the standard table into a triangle_
Hint: %>% as.triangle(...)

```{r}
Paid_HH_sml_triangle <- Paid_HH_sml %>% 
  as.triangle(origin="ay", dev="dy", value="SumOfamount")
```

_STEP 3: Now start plotting things to see more information_

```{r}
Paid_HH_sml_triangle
plot(Paid_HH_sml_triangle)
plot(predict(chainladder(Paid_HH_sml_triangle)))
```

_STEP 4: And get the aging factors and some other stat's out to see more details_
Hint: ata(...)

```{r}
ata(Paid_HH_sml_triangle)
```

_Now repeat for all types of buiness and sizes of claims. Compare the findings..._

```{r}
#Paid_HH_big <- ...
#Paid_..._... <- ...

```

_If you are now comforatble with what this does, try doing the same, but using additional information: The Case data!_
Hint: Sum Paid and Case together to come up with the final claims estimates (the Incurred claims)

```{r}
Incur_HH_sml <- dt_PaidCase %>% 
  filter(Business == "House" & ClaimSize == "Small") %>%
  group_by(Business,ClaimSize,ay,dy) %>%
  summarise(SumOfamount=sum(SumOfamount)) %>%
  select(ay:SumOfamount) %>% as.triangle(origin="ay", dev="dy", value="SumOfamount") ## %>% incr2cum(na.rm = TRUE)

plot(Incur_HH_sml)
plot(predict(chainladder(Incur_HH_sml)))

ata(Incur_HH_sml)
```


### Short or Long tail
In insurance this means how fast is the data fully developed. The age-to-age factors help you understand exactly this. What would the age-to-age factors look like to make the business short/long tail? Are the lines of business in the exercise above short or long tailed? Try to come up with the meant payment term (weighted average of the duration until the claim is paid)

So hopefully by this time you know how the losses were calculated for you to use in previous class...


#### Exercise 3
There are a couple of different types of business in the data from previous lesson. 
What do you think, how long are the average delays in payments? Set up a table, that will 
_show your assumptions and commit it to your git repository._
```{r}
summary(dt_KPI)
```

### Discounting  losses
It is very unlikely, that we incur the whole loss on the *very first day*. This allows the insurance company to *invest* the premium received and earn som interest on it. So one way of thinking about our previous example would be to think about *the future value of money* collected at the time of the claim. In reality we need to know the answers now, so *discounting the losses* is more practical then earning interest on expenses.

Let's check the data now. Were your expectations above supported by the calculation?
Add comments to your notes if needed...


#### Exercise 4
Use the data provided in exercise 2 and try to come up with an estimates of the average duration. 
How does it work? Well, discounting apart, in what year does the average payment happen? 
HINT: (Here you definitely use paid claims, and it is enough to calculate weighted average of incremental payment)

_STEP 1: get the weights of incremental paid triangle => this is what we are intrested in because individual payments matter_

```{r}
Incremental_Paid_HH_sml <- Paid_HH_sml_triangle %>% cum2incr() %>% ata() %>% attr("vwtd")
```

_STEP 2: average duration (calculate a weighted sum, where the weight is the number of year/total cummulative paid sum)_

```{r}
sum(Incremental_Paid_HH_sml / cumsum(Incremental_Paid_HH_sml)[9] *c(1:9))
```

_Does the value calculated correspond to your assumed value for the given business in Exercise 2? Comment on the findings in your notes..._


Now let’s try to be more exact. What do we need to calculate this? Of course the interest rates, 
but let’s park that for now and use just [risk free rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-free_interest_rate). 

So what is the other most important factor?

Usually we would use a formula like this one: `Loss_y = Loss_x * (1 + interest)^(y-x)`

The durations until payments `(y-x)` is a generic answer. Information about the claims history 
and the payments will help us derive it.
We can start at simple averaging (as in the previous exercise) and saying that is the duration discounting for the period equal to aveage duration.
But we can be more precise in weighting and use the age-to-age factors more precisely. So let's try that... This detailed approach is usually used with the Swap rates for individual durations. You can try that at home...


#### Exercise 5 
Now, assume an interest rate of 5%. How will the discounting change this?
_Calculate a factor to be applied to the final incurred claims, to make discout it to present value._

Let's start simply: What would the average disocunt factor be? Use the average duration from Exercise 4

```{r}
1.05^(-sum(Incremental_Paid_HH_sml / cumsum(Incremental_Paid_HH_sml)[9] *c(1:9)))
```

_Now let's be more precise and use the appropriate weights and individual discount factors one by one_
Hint: Discount every term of the sum in Exercise 3 by appropriate discount factor (1+i)^(-year)

```{r}
sum(Incremental_Paid_HH_sml / cumsum(Incremental_Paid_HH_sml)[9] * (1/1.05^c(1:9)))
```

Recall what is UWR from Lesson 2. Assume premium and expenses are calculated on day 1.
_Can you calculate a sigle number, that could be used to discount the claims to arrive to Net present value of UWR?_


#### Exercise 6
Now, let’s have a look at it from the other way around. 
The following dataset includes the same data you were analysing in class 2, but it is all discounted...

```{r}
NPV_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/sk000413/Documents/University/GeneralInsurance_2019/GeneralInsurance_Class/Data/lesson4_NPV.csv")
```

_What is the average duration in all of these cases assuming a discount rate of 5%?_

```{r}
head(NPV_data)
1/1.05^c(1:9) #this means it will be somewhere less then 1 year
NPV_data %>% select("NPV.Loss","NPV.NEP","NPV.Expense") %>% filter(NPV.Loss>0 & NPV.NEP>0 & NPV.Expense>0) %>% log(1/1.05) %>% summary()
```

_What is the worst performing portfolio now?_
(Hint: Create additional shiny graphs, but using the discounted values)


### Capital requirements
To make it even more real, we need to take into account another perspective as well. 
This is the amount of money we need to hold to be able to pay the claims right when they appear. 
In here the *claims volatility* kicks in.

Imagine you are starting insuring against flood.

The floods usually happen once every 100 years and when it happens, it destroys your house significantly. 

You have collected some reasonable premium, that is probably less then the value of the loss you can expect 
(no one would pay the same amount of money that the repair will cost to the insurance company, as they would 
rather save it in a bank). The next year, the flood comes... and so the insurance company must pay... 
*But do they have enough money?* How much money would you expect them to have? (reflect in your notes sections) 
 
 
#### Exercise 7
Imagine there are 100 houses around a river and each is worth 100,000.
A big flood happens once every 100 and destroys everything.
A small one every 5 years and destroys 1 house.
_What is the average loss per year (simple premium)? What is the volatility of the losses?_

```{r}
# 1 in 100 loss
premium100 <- 100 * 100000 / 100
volatility100 <- rep(0, times = 100)
volatility100[1] <- 100000
volatility100 <- sd(volatility100)
premium5 <- 1 * 100000 / 5
volatility5 <- rep(0, times = 5)
volatility5[1] <- 100000
volatility5 <- sd(volatility5)
```

_How much do you think a reasonable premium should be to protect the customers?_


### Risk based capital
Insurance industry is very regulated. One of the main reason is the situation above. No government wants it's people
to be unprotected or unpaid if a claim happens. That means, an insurance company must have some extra money on top of the expected claim payments to allow for the event to happen at different times then just average occurances (once every 100 year like in example above).

What is driving the capital requirement?


#### Exercise 8
_Think about why a portfolio may need more (or less) capital to be allowed to insure business. Write down your ideas into your notes._
```{r}
# any idea counts ;)
```
Obviously, the bigger the size, the more capital is needed. But this still does not meant something is more or less risky.
It is much better to weight the requirement by size. For this reason we use 
`Capital_Intensity_Ratio(CIR) = Required_Capital / Net_Earned_Premium(NEP)`.


#### Exercise 9
Use the following data [CIR] to try to come up with some examples that support your ideas from your reflection in previous exercise.
_Look at the data provided. Identify examples, where 2 portfolios are similar (1 dimension is different), and the CIR is bigger or smaller. Be creative and find any dependencies..._

```{r}
CIR_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/sk000413/Documents/University/GeneralInsurance_2019/GeneralInsurance_Class/Data/lesson4_CIR.csv")
summary(CIR_data)
#...
```

What is the total value of capital required to run the whole business from lesson 2?
Use the data provided that refers to the same portfolios, you were looking at in lesson2. 
How has it changed over the years?

```{r}
# we need to sum Required Capital = CIR * NEP
# first, join data together on the first 4 columns
# summary(dt_KPI)
# summary(CIR_data)
combined_data <- inner_join(dt_KPI,CIR_data, 
                            by = c("Region" = "Region",
                                   "Unit" = "Unit",
                                   "Segment" = "Segment",
                                   "Business" = "Business",
                                   "Year" = "Year"))
sum(combined_data$CIR * combined_data$Premium)
```

### Cost of capital
As in the example above, there is no way for a starting insurance company to collect enough money up front. They are borrowed from shareholders or banks. These require interest in excess of risk free rate. You can try to find out a reasonable risk margin for insurance companies in google (depending on their rating and risk profile). Let's assume, we need to return additiona 10% on top of the money that we borrow. Let's also assume we have no free capital now and we have to borrow everything.
 
How does this additional challenge change the porfitabilty of the buiness?


#### Exercise 10  => Homeworks (group everything together)
_Using the same data we have discounted, try to allow for additional 10% (on top of risk free rate) of the capital needed for that portfolio._
What is the Economic profit before tax (NPV UWR - Capital costs) for each
portfolio? Which one of them is the most profitable? Is the worst one from previous investigation still the worst?

STEPS:
You know what the Mean term is of the data (also part of CIR_data as the last column), as you know what the discount factors are 
and you assumed 5% discount rate (Exercies 6) - chose whichevery you find more reasonable.
You also know what the capital intensity ratios are (Exercise 9).
You also know the Net Earned Premium from earlier lessons (dt_KPI)
How much does it cost to hold the Capital amount in terms of interest paid for that for the average (Mean Term) period?
Now you can combine everything and calculate teh Economic Profit :)
Hint1: Using 'dplyr' package and function left_join requires column names to be the same to join...


### Latest view of the loss development - EXTRA
Ok, so now you should know something about triangles and discounting and capital and how it all links together. 
There is another use of the triangles though and the very last adjustment to our profitability.
As the external capital is usually quite expensive, insurers need to sometimes strengthen the reserves to have more money saved for adverse claims (like the flood in the capital section). There are also claims, that have happened and we are not aware of yet, which is another reason for having extra money saved. Over the years, the reserves are released, as claims are paid and the money is not needed. So can we somehow project what the future losses will be after all reserve releases?
There is an additional dataset provided, that shows historical view of the losses for a given year, and it is updated year on year.


#### BONUS HOMEWORK CANDIDATE - EXTRA BONUS
Use this final triangle to come up with your view on what the ultimate loss for 2016 will look like for every portfolio.
Calculate the extra money, that will be released in a couple of years.
Present the latest view NPV UWR for all portfolios and show that as a diagnostic in your dashboard from lesson 2.
